# Home Page Optimization Todo List

## Current Issues Analysis
- **Redundant Content**: Specials and events are shown in both hero and dedicated sections
- **Fake Reviews**: All reviews are 5-star fake reviews that don't add credibility
- **Weak Online Ordering**: Demo section is uninspiring and doesn't drive sales
- **Poor Information Hierarchy**: Too much content competing for attention
- **Missing Conversion Focus**: Not optimized for pickup/delivery orders or driving foot traffic

## Optimization Strategy
Focus on **conversion-driven design** that drives online orders and foot traffic while maintaining the authentic bar atmosphere.

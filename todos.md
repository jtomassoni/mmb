2. **üì± Created New Picker Components**:
   - `NewDatePicker` - Uses `react-date-wheel-picker` for smooth date selection

   - Only warnings remain (mostly TypeScript `any` types)
   - Professional picker libraries now handle all scroll behavior
   - **BUILD VERIFIED**: `npm run build` completes successfully ‚úÖ

6. **üîß Fixed Picker Issues**:
   - Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" error in time picker
   - Added safe index calculations to prevent out-of-bounds errors
   - Fixed date off-by-1 issue by using local date formatting instead of ISO string
   - Added error handling and validation for time parsing
   - **BUILD VERIFIED**: All picker fixes work correctly ‚úÖ

### **Result:**
